### This is a calculator project that was done individually and it took about 1 hour and it also had its own challenges

## Main description:
### This project is such that it takes the first number from the user and then we take the operand from the user by using conditional commands to specify that if the user enters a positive sign ("*"), it will be added to the next number that he is going to enter.

### I hope it was useful for you </:>
